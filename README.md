# Smart-Recipe-Platform
An integrated system for managing food recipes: it extracts details (title, image, ingredients, steps) via Selenium, cleans and saves data in Excel, uses DeepSeek API for refined text, and auto-publishes via Blogger, combining web scraping, data processing, API interaction, and online publishing.
