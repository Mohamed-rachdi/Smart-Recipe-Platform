# Smart-Recipe-Platform
This project is an integrated system for managing food recipes that covers extraction, processing, and publishing. It starts with a web application that uses Selenium to browse recipe websites and extract key information such as the recipe title, image, ingredients, and steps. After cleaning and formatting the data, the processed information is saved in Excel files. The system then utilizes the DeepSeek API to transform the extracted content into well-formatted text by sending the data and receiving comprehensive responses that include a refined recipe title and formatted content. Finally, another module publishes these recipes on a website via the Blogger platform by automatically filling in the necessary fields like title, content, and tags, ensuring the completeness of the content before publication. This project demonstrates the effective integration of web scraping, data processing, API interaction, and online publishing to manage food content efficiently.
